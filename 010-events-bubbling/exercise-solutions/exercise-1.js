/*
    1. Create an HTML file with a <head> with a
       <title> in it with some text, as well as
       a <body> tag
       
    2. Add a <table>, with a table head and table
       body with some table data of your choice.

    3. How would you use an event/listener to
       log out the text of the <td> that was clicked?
       (Try to do this with only ONE listener, so even
        if more <td> were added, it would still work)

    4. Open the file in your Browser and open up
       the dev tools to verify the log when you
       click each table item
