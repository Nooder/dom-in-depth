/*
    1. Create an HTML file with a <head> with a
       <title> in it with some text, as well as
       a <body> tag
       
    2. Add a <table>, with a table head and table
       body with some table data of your choice.

    3. Add an event listener to the table body or
       one of the table cells to print out the text
       inside the cell/target. How and where would you
       add another event listener to STOP the event 
       from reaching its target (never prints)?

    4. Open the file in your Browser and open up
       the dev tools to verify the log when you
       click each table item
