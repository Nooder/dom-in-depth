/* 
    1. Create an HTML file with a <head> with a
       <title> in it with some text, as well as
       a <body> tag

    2. Add a <form> element with a text input
       inside as well as a 'submit' button

    3. How would you make it so when you add text
       and submit the form, you print out the text
       in the input WITHOUT reloading the page?

    4. Open the file in your Browser and open up
       the dev tools to verify this

    HINT* We want to prevent the default form behaviour
